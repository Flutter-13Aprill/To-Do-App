# 📘  ToDo App — Overview


This application is a robust task management tool that allows users to register accounts, add tasks, and update their completion status using Supabase as the backend. It offers real-time interaction with the database, enabling efficient organization and tracking of daily tasks.

The app also includes local profile customization features, allowing users to change their display name and profile picture directly within the app, without relying on Supabase or any external storage service.

With a focus on usability and performance, the app delivers a seamless user experience for managing tasks and personal settings.
