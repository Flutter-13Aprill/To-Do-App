# ⚔️ Rest in Peace, O Knight Mohammed 🛡️  

### *A Tribute to the End of a Glorious Streak*

There comes a time when even the fiercest fire must dim, when even the most unstoppable force must pause.  

Every streak — no matter how legendary — must meet its inevitable end.  

---

Today, I sheath my sword, not in defeat, but as a warrior honoring the battles won.  

A streak forged in fire, unbroken — until this moment.  

**Rest in peace, O Knight Mohammed.**  

The code will not flow today.  
The streak is halted, not shattered but standing down, not by failure, but by the weight of the fight.  

---

This project shall be completed — not today.  

The fire inside will blaze anew after Eid Al-Adha, sharper, stronger, and relentless, with a mind honed like the edge of a blade, ready to conquer what lies ahead.  

Until then, silence this repo, and hold the banner of Mohammed high — folded, but never fallen.

## 📌 Note to the Reader

This repository marks a pause, not weakness but calculated strength, not surrender but strategy.  

The Knight will rise again, and when he does, let all projects beware.
