  - Session management via Supabase‚Äôs built-in authentication API.

- **To-Do Management**  
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) to-do items.  
  - Data is stored in Supabase PostgreSQL tables.  
  - Real-time updates: If you‚Äôre logged in from multiple devices, to-dos sync instantly.

  - A smooth, multi-page introduction slider that explains the app‚Äôs core features.  
  - Easy navigation between onboarding screens with smooth page indicators.

  - View tasks on a monthly calendar (powered by `table_calendar`).  
  - Quickly jump to specific dates and see tasks scheduled for that day.

- **Localization (Easy Localization)**  
  - Multi-language support using `easy_localization`.  
  - English (default) out of the box. Additional languages can be added easily.

- **Responsive Design (Sizer)**  
  - Layout adapts to different screen sizes (phones/tablets) using the `sizer` package.  
  - Consistent UI on iOS and Android.

- **State Management (flutter_bloc + get_it)**  
  - Business logic and state flows are managed via `flutter_bloc`.  
  - Dependency injection and service location via `get_it`.

- **Environment Configuration (flutter_dotenv)**  
  - Sensitive API keys, Supabase URL, and Supabase Anon Key are stored in a `.env` file (not committed to source control).

- **Smooth Native Splash Screen**  
  - Boot-up splash screen configured via `flutter_native_splash`.
